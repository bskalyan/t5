Hi,

The issue with MOE has been resolved, and I am now able to see the proper output. Please find the screenshot and code attached below for OCR.

I have tested both Tesseract and Poppler, and the outputs and code are included. I will compare the results and provide an update on where exactly the issue occurs and which option performs better. Once that is done, I will proceed to work on AWS Textract.
